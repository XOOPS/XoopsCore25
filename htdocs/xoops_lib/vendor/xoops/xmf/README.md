XMF (XOOPS Module Framework)
===

This is the XOOPS Module Framework for XOOPS 2.5.x and XOOPS 2.6.x

XOOPS Module Framework is a selection of classes and supporting files intended to help simplify
many of the routine tasks commonly needed in module development. This simplification also gives
you some degree of compatibility as you move your module from 2.5 to 2.6.
