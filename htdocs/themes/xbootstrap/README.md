###Shareaholic support
Previously, social sharing links through Shareaholic were automatically enabled.
These are now optional and disabled by default. To enable Shareaholic support
follow these steps:

- Visit https://shareaholic.com to create an account and register your site
- Take note of the Site Id code Shareaholic assigns to your site
- Open the template file tpl/shareaholic-script.tpl in your editor
- Replace the *n/a* in this line `<{assign var='siteId' value='n/a'}>` with the *Site Id* Shareaholic assigned to you, and save the file

You can customize how Shareaholic interacts with your site in the Site Tools
Dashboard on shareaholic.com. You may want to create an Inline App Location
on that page to customize the Share Buttons. These buttons will be shown in
templates such as modules/publisher/publisher_item.tpl with this line:
`<div class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-app-id=''></div>`
